# Adaptive Micro-Inverter with Harmonic Compensation

This is a solo electrical project I'm building as a final-year EEE student.

# Goal
To build a micro-inverter that can adapt to changing loads and reduce harmonic distortion in real time.

# Core Features
- Grid-tied inverter control
- Adaptive harmonic compensation using filters
- Simulation + hardware plan
- Real-time feedback

# Why I'm Building This
This project helps me apply what I’ve learned in power electronics and drives, and prepares me for working on real-world grid problems and electric vehicles.

# Project Timeline
- Simulation setup (In Progress)
- Controller design
- Harmonic filter design
- Hardware prototype 

# Skills applied/learnt
- MATLAB / Simulink
- Power electronics (PWM, THD)
- Embedded system control (later)
- Documentation & presentation


I'm a beginner — this is my learning journey. Mistakes welcome. Feedback appreciated!
